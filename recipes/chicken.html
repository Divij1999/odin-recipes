    <h3>Description</h4>
     <p>I make a lot of chicken recipes but none have recieved the praise I've gotten for this. This is the most moist thing ever.

     </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 package dry French onion soup mix</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breastts</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs and dry soup mix together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise and garlic paste together in a separate bowl. Microwave on high to thin out consistency, 20 to 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Brush chicken breasts with the mayonnaise mixture. Cover with the crumb mixture. Place on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
